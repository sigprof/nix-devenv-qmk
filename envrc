# Shared direnv for `qmk_firmware`.
#
# This file is intended to be loaded from `.envrc` inside your `qmk_firmware`
# directory, using a statement like:
#
#     source_env ~/path/to/nix-devenv-qmk/envrc
#
# Note that this file itself is **not** named `.envrc`, because it should not
# be used as a direnv for `nix-devenv-qmk` itself.

# Break NIX_PATH on purpose to avoid duplicate cache entries in `.direnv/`
# (normally `use nix` creates a new entry there after any nixpkgs update, but
# with the locked nixpkgs version used by `shell.nix` this is not actually
# required).
NIX_PATH=nixpkgs=/dev/null use nix
