# Shared direnv for `qmk_firmware`.
#
# This file is intended to be loaded from `.envrc` inside your `qmk_firmware`
# directory, using a statement like:
#
#     source_env ~/path/to/nix-devenv-qmk/envrc
#
# Note that this file itself is **not** named `.envrc`, because it should not
# be used as a direnv for `nix-devenv-qmk` itself.
